# Ovarian Cancer Cell Detection Using CNNs (GUBMES HDA 23-24)
[Project in progress]

## Description
This repository contains code written by the Glasgow University Biomedical Engineering Society's Health Data Analytics Research Division (2023-24). This code leverages the dataset provided by the University of British Columbia as a part of their Ovarian Cancer Detection competition hosted on Kaggle. This project aims to create a machine learning model that is able to distinguish between ovarian cancer and its various sub-classes by training a pre-trained network (Resnet) on histopathology images.
